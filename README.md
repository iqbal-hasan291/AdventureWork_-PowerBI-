Adventure Works Story in Numbers
📌 Project Overview

This project is built on the Adventure Works dataset and developed in Power BI. The goal was to transform transactional data into a business story, uncovering insights that can guide strategy and decision-making.

The report is designed across multiple pages:

Overview Dashboard → snapshot of revenue, profit, orders, and returns

Territory Analysis → identifying regions with the highest contribution

Customer Analysis + RFM Segmentation → classifying customers into loyal, active, and at-risk groups

Product Analysis → revenue difference, price adjustment impact, and target tracking

Tree Diagram Analysis → mapping orders by gender → product → subcategory

🗂 Data Modeling

Created a star schema connecting fact and dimension tables

Cleaned and structured data for customers, products, territories, and sales

Established relationships to enable dynamic filtering and drill-throughs

Built DAX measures for KPIs: revenue, profit, orders, returns, and customer metrics

❓ Problem Statement

How can Adventure Works enhance its sales strategy, customer retention, and product pricing through insights from sales, customer behavior, and regional performance data?
