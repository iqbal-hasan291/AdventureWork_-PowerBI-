# Adventure Works Story in Numbers

## Project Overview
This project is built on the **Adventure Works dataset** using **Power BI**. The goal was to transform transactional data into a **business story**, uncovering insights that can guide strategic decisions.

The report includes multiple pages:  
- **Overview Dashboard:** snapshot of revenue, profit, orders, and returns  
- **Territory Analysis:** identifying regions with the highest contribution  
- **Customer Analysis + RFM Segmentation:** classifying customers into loyal, active, and at-risk groups  
- **Product Analysis:** revenue difference, price adjustment impact, and target tracking  
- **Tree Diagram Analysis:** mapping orders by gender → product → subcategory for better decision-making

## Data Modeling
- Built a **snowflake schema** connecting fact and dimension tables  
- Cleaned and structured tables for customers, products, territories, and sales  
- Established relationships to enable dynamic filtering and drill-throughs

## Problem Statement
How can Adventure Works improve its **sales strategy, customer retention, and product pricing** through insights from sales, customer behavior, and regional performance data?

## Tools & Technology
- **Power BI** → dashboard design, visualization, DAX measures  
- **Excel** → validation and quick checks  
- **GitHub** → project documentation and sharing

## Method
1. Data modeling and transformation  
2. Dashboard design with multiple report pages  
3. RFM segmentation for customer retention analysis  
4. Territory performance breakdown  
5. Product analysis with **price adjustment and revenue difference**  
6. Tree diagram visualization for customer buying patterns  
7. Target tracking with line charts to monitor performance month over month

### Other Findings
- **Top Category:** Bikes had the highest order volume  
- **Top Region:** Australia generated the most orders  
- **Customer Segments:**  
  - Lower middle class → highest number of orders (4.5K)  
  - Professionals → highest revenue contribution (avg spend $1.49K)  
- **Product Analysis:** Price adjustments revealed how small % changes influenced total revenue difference  
- **Tree Diagram:** Orders broken down by gender → product → subcategory, highlighting key buying behaviors for decision-making  
- **RFM Segmentation:** Identified loyal customers and customers needing re-engagement

## Dashboards
Screenshots of the Power BI dashboards are included in the repository.
